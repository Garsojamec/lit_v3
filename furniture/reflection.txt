# Potential Considerations
## Schema for Considering Furniture ( note overlap w/ tools, machines, etc )
- Material Composition ( Wooden, Plastic, Metal, etc )
- Symbolic/Decorative/Religious Purpose ( Sex, Privacy, Fortune, Joy, Relief, Spirituality, etc )
- Intended, Designed Usage ( Containing, Sleeping, Eating, Lying, Physically Support, Labor, etc )
- General Affordances ( Horizontal Surface, Vertical Surface, Foldable/Collapsable, Discreetness, etc )

## Interrelating, Contrasting, and Correlating Schema
### Material Composition
- Can be indicated on a separate SDT and then used a modifier. Said SDT likely will have a nominalizing form so that one can say "item that is made of material X"; though we could then modify some word for "furniture" with "item that is made of material X" to say "furniture [that is made of material X]".
-- This approach seems more flexible to me.
-- Pending other schema, might be nice sugar to allow simply "furniture made of X" built-into SDT, but i'm hesitant for rn.

### Intended, Designed Usage
- This is akin to tools & tech/machines.
- Potentially tricky to disambiguate, but still meaningful.
- Possible furniture words ppl may want to make could be helped here:
-- bed, work table, stool, table-for-eating, chair, loveseat, couch, sofa, rocking chair, divan, cabinet, cupboard, mirror, dresser, amoire, etc
- mixed thoughts....

### General Affordances
- Suppose we have the following main taxonomic approach:
-- 1  General/Neutral
-- 2  Horizontal Supporting Surface Against Gravity
-- 3  Fit/Hold/Contain as Internal-External Partition
-- 4  [MAYBE???]Container/Holder[MAYBE???]

- Then we could have 2ndAry Inflection ( Vowel Infix ) to convey what we are appreciating of said Furniture
--  a Symbolic/decorative
--  i intended, designed Usage
--  u special property(?)

- So then we now could have:
2.i.sleep = Horizontal/Supporting Surface Against Gravity Itended/Designed to Facilitate Sleeping
3.i.privacy = Internal-External Partition designed to faciltiate privacy
1.i.[] light-emittance - Lamp

Curtains
-> 3.i.Cloth
