- A tubular vessel which carries blood
- A component of the circulatory system that transports blood through the body

5 Types ( There are more )
- Arteries
-- Blood away from the heart
- Arterioles
- Capillaries
-- Exchange of water & chemiclas between blood and tissue
- Venules
- Veins
-- Carries blood back to heart
